Recommendations:
The new line of credit cards can be introduced in 3 phases based on insights generated :
1. Persons living in Mumbai, are salaried IT employees, are married and are in the age group 25-34 and 35-45 :
These customers should be primary target in the first phase. This segment of customers is already using credit cards. So no awareness is required to be generated for this segment. These should be primary target for starters. Once this is done, Salaried IT employees in other cities like Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad should be next target. Campaigns  should be carried out to reach to these customers.
2. Once we have established our credit card business in above 5 cities by targeting salaried IT employees in the age groups 25-34 and 35-45, our next course of actions can be to reach out to business owners, other salaried employees in the age group . This segment of customers is using credit cards but not very frequently. Targeted campaigns to reach out to this segment should be the focus in second phase.
3. In the third phase, freelancers and Government employees in the age groups 25-34 and 35-45 should be the next target. This segment of customers is not using credit cards. First of all awareness campaigns need to be carried out with this segment in primary focus. Cash backs can be introduced on day to day items such as groceries to lure this segment.
For the time being, we should not focus on age groups 21-24 and 45 + because this segment rarely use credit card and if they do, the transactions amounts are pretty low as compared to other two segments.
